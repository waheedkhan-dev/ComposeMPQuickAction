# KMM Quick Action Handler with Jetpack Compose

This Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) project demonstrates how to handle **iOS Home Screen Quick Actions** and pass that data from Swift (iOS) to shared Kotlin code, which then updates the **Jetpack Compose UI** using a `StateFlow`.

## âœ¨ Features

- Handles iOS Home Screen Quick Actions (`UIApplicationShortcutItem`)
- Passes selected quick action from Swift to Kotlin Multiplatform (`commonMain`)
- Uses `StateFlow` to expose the selected action to Jetpack Compose UI
- Dynamically updates UI in response to quick action
